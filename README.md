#Vision Zero Innovation Lab

###Background
Taking place at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics on April 27th during the Leeds Digital Festival, the aim of the Vision Zero Innovation Lab is to explore ways to reduce the number of road casualties to zero in Leeds. If you would like to get involved or find out more, check out the event [on eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/vision-zero-innovation-lab-leeds-digital-festival-tickets-21587524868).

Student Data Labs runs data-driven Innovation Labs for university students to learn practical data skills whilst working on civic problems. In the past, we have held Labs that tackle Type 2 Diabetes. Student Data Labs works with an interdisciplinary team of students, data scientists, designers, researchers and software developers. We also aim to connect our Data Lab Volunteers with local employers who may be interested in employing them upon graduation.

The Vision Zero Innovation Lab is split into two sections: a Learning Lab and a Innovation Lab. The Learning Lab helps students learn real-world data skills - getting them up and running with tools like R as well as common data science problems as part of a team. The Innovation Lab is more experimental, where the aim is to develop ideas and data-driven tools to take on wicked problems.


##Data
The Labs make use of open data - that is, data that has been made open and freely available to the public. We are using open data from [Leeds Data Mill](http://leedsdatamill.org/), some of which was created Student Data Labs and other that have been cleansed before the event.

##Resources
Under Resources, you will find resources that will help with those looking to learn more about data science. You can find: practical tutorials, code and documents that detail the data science workflow. You can also check out the resources from our [Health Innovation Lab](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lpn47z908p8lbub/AAC0f3EaGEzeK_NvjU24NEjUa?dl=0), which contains similar tools and videos.
